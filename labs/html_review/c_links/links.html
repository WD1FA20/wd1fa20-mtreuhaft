    <h1>Favorite Websites</h1>
    <h2>Websites that I visit most frequently: A snapshot of my current life in quarantine.</h2>
    <h3>YouTube</h3>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" alt="YouTube">YouTube</a>
    <p>I visit YouTube often because I need to show my students how to do simple tasks like tracing and it is much faster to find a video of someone tracing than to record my own video.</p>
    <h3>Instagram</h3>
    <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" alt="Instagram">Instagram</a>
    <p>I find that during the fires and the general sense of panic, I am reaching out to friends on Instagram. These are friends I don't normally talk with but people I'd like to check in with due to the emergency situation.</p>
    <h3>AirNow</h3>
    <a href="https://www.airnow.gov/" alt="AirNow">AirNow</a>
    <p>I check AirNow constantly because I am concerned about air quality.</p>
    <h3>Canvas</h3>
    <a href="https://learn.canvas.net/login/canvas" alt="Canvas">Canvas</a>
    <p>My job as an instructor requires me to spend a lot of time developing cohesive content on Canvas for my various classes. </p>
