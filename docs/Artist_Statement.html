    Painting and drawing constitute the roots of my practice and inform my work as I explore new media. Light, shadow and transparency are major concerns in my two dimensional abstractions and take on new meaning as I expand into more dimensions. In the last few years, I have been making immersive theater-inspired installations that incorporate painting, animation and video projection. These installations feature complex surfaces that are subjected to various forms of (moving) light. I am also currently learning a programming software called Processing in order to add more interactive components to my video and installation projects.

    <i>CAST</i>, my MFA exhibition, explored the layering of paint and light in such a way that the individuality of each layer was obscured. Overhead projectors threw painted transparencies upon 8’ x 11’ painted paper backdrops. It was unclear where the actual painting ended and the projection began. Neon lights were programed to fade on and off at an almost imperceptibly slow rate. <i>CAST</i> was an environment composed of complex visual stimuli changing slowly over time.

    Dynamic installation work has brought me into fruitful partnerships with thoughtful professionals committed to diverse fields. Both the possibilities and practical limitations of our distinct media require careful coordination and inspire new directions. With architect, Tammy LePham, and sound artist, Shanna Sordahl, <a target="_blank" href='https://ctrlshftcollective.com/STAGING'><i>Staging</i></a> transformed Oakland gallery, CTRL+SHFT into an abstraction of the theatrical set. Three rooms, connected by the overspill of sound and light, allowed viewers to create their own narrative journey through the space. Painted floor panels bolstered the impression that one was standing in a theatrical set.

    Our second installation project, <a target="_blank" href="projects.html"></a><i>The World Evades Us</i></a>  at 1078 Gallery, was a sculptural abstraction of the North Valley landscape. Hollow cardboard columns heavily textured with glue, joint compound, and mulch were placed in a grid representing an aerial map of the valley. The “orchard” of columns created a disruptive projection surface for videos that appeared to be sliced vertically. Funded in part by a City of Chico Arts and Culture grant, there was a significant outreach and educational component to the show. It included various artist talks, a panel discussion and an interactive informational area that asked viewers to describe their personal relationship to the North Valley landscape. One community member’s video footage of Paradise, CA post-Campfire was carefully incorporated into the projections.

    The videos I create, as independent projects and as projection material for installations, are often moving versions of my paintings. Using animation software like Adobe After Effects, I manipulate photos of my drawings and paintings and alter the video footage I’ve shot. I then add computer generated shapes and effects. Occasionally, I’ll collaborate with musicians to incorporate sound as in <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com/243579151"><i>Shady Window Tones</i></a>  with sound by Addison DeSantis.

    Theater productions, <a target="_blank" href='https://latinartsfest.com/2018-program/'><i>Rosacea</i></a> (by Rosa Boshier, funded by CalArts) and <a target="_blank" href='https://missionculturalcenter.org/event/prida-project/'><i>The Prida Project</i></a> at San Francisco's Mission Cultural Center (funded by The Zellerbach Foundation) included my videos and projection design. Both plays addressed the timelessness of political and emotional responses to immigration issues in the United States and Great Britain. The videos constituted the majority of the set surrounding the actors and incorporated surreal animations combined with often jarring imagery from the news. These projects celebrate collaboration and explore the potential of disparate media to combine and take on new power.
